# Ideal Point Estimation of US Political Blogs
Social networks contain invaluable information regarding actors in the network. Given actors' social connections and plausible motivations behind the establishment of these relations, one may infer actors' unobserved characteristics, which are of interest by themselves or can have further use.

In this project, I develop a method to estimate actors' socioeconomic ideologies using network data. The social network considered here can be represented by a directed graph that contains binary relations directed from one actor to another (e.g, following or citation). Actors in the social network establish connections because of their ideological similarity. 

I study a network data of online political blogs collected by Adamic and Glance (2005). This data is publicly available from
[http://nexus.igraph.org/]. It contains blogroll links and post citations of 1490 political blogs before the US Presidential Election of 2004. In our term, a blog establishes a connection with another blog if it cites or creates a blogroll link of the other blog.
